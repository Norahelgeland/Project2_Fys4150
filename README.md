- Task 2 is in the sourcefile Task2.cpp
- task 3 is in the Max_offdiag_symmetric.hpp file and it is run together with the test in the Test_task3.cpp file
- Task 4 is in the jacobi.hpp file and it is run in the Task4.cpp file. It uses the matrix from the creating_matrix.hpp file.
- Task 5 is in the Task5.cpp file and it uses the functions from the jacobi.hpp file and the matrix from  creating_matrix.hpp
  - The parameter dense can be set to true or false. If it is true, it makes a dense matrix, if it says false it makes the tridiagonal matrix
- Task 6 is in the Task6.cpp file and it uses the Creating_matrix.hpp and Jacobi.hpp files
